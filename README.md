## Introduction

secsp is a C-style SELinux policy language for the High-Level Language Infrastructure.  It targets CIL, and takes inspiration from
refpolicy and the kernel policy language in it's syntax.

**NOTE**: This repository is currently largely a work in progress and undergoing a major rewrite.
For an idea of what currently works (and what is being worked on) see the [issues](https://github.com/garyttierney/secsp/issues) page..
