= Architecture

The implementation of the `secsp` language is split across several re-usable Rust crates that are consumed by both the compiler and analysis server.
The intention is that the compiler and analysis server rely on the same code to do their job and can be developed in parallel.

More details on the individual crates can be found below.

== secsp-syntax

The parser implementation and AST representation.

This crate is inspired by the work done by JetBrains on their https://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/basics/architectural_overview/psi.html[PSI architecture] and the work done on the https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer[rust-analyzer] project.

// TODO: Flesh this out.
